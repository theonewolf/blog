# Hello, Blog!

Finally starting on a new adventure.  I'm using
[`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), because
I'm familiar with that as a developer.  I believe it produces beautiful output.
It also uses very simple Markdown, YAML, and directory structure.  This makes
it easy to maintain, and to reach my goal of 4 blog posts this year.

We won't count this post, this is just getting things off the ground!
